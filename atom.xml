    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Reactor-Pattern-Part-1-Non-blocking-I-O/">Reactor Pattern Part 1 : Applications with Blocking I/O</a>, I went through issues faced by a single threaded application to scale to handle more requests pre box and the corresponding issues it introduces. In <a href="http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Reactor-Pattern-Part-2-Non-blocking-I-O/">Reactor Pattern Part 2 : Applications with Non-Blocking I/O</a> I went through what Reactor Pattern is and how it fixes the Blocking IO issues and mentioned call back issue that async code introduces.</p>

<p>Lets get little more detail on what the callback issues are and introduce few options or libraries used to partially solve the issue, in this blog.</p>

<p><b><i>Example scenario</i></b></p>

<p>Consider a simple scenario where Restful service has to return a list of events for a given user. User is identified by Facebook Id. The service datastore has two tables or collections, (a) User table and (b) Event table which stores.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>user information</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>fb_id</li>
<li>name</li>
<li>&hellip;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>events information.</p>

<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>user_id</li>
<li>event_name</li>
<li>event_desc</li>
<li>start_date</li>
<li>&hellip;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Assuming, you are not allowed to join user and event table or datastore is mongodb. The service controller will use below Pseudocode steps to get events.</p>

<ul>
<li>Given facebook id, get user id from User collection</li>
<li>Given user id, get events for the user from  events collection.</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Sequential Code with Blocking I/O</i></b></p>

<p>In normal scenario the above steps directly translate to below code. If performance or scalability is not something playing on developers mind, Sequential code is the simplest and normal thing to do.</p>

<p>There are religious wars between Ruby on Rails and NodeJS developers on Sequential Vs Evented style code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Key Points

<ul>
<li>Majority of web applications (Ruby on Rails, Java Spring, Django etc) are written in sequential style.</li>
<li>Sequential style is simple and readable.</li>
<li>Most people think in sequential style i.e. Developers tend to break application logic into sequential steps like Pseudocode provided above.</li>
<li>Boundaries of Pseudocode Step does not usually end at network call or IO call.</li>
<li>Non-blocking I/O is considered when we need better scalabilty or performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately Sequential code is linked to blocking I/O calls, becuase threads follow pre-emptive multitasking and not co-operative multitaking. More on this later when talking about Fibers.</p>

<p><b><i>Callback based solution</i></b></p>

<p>To solve Blocking I/O problem, code is split to three parts</p>

<ol>
<li>Processing done before making a network or IO call</li>
<li>Network or IO call</li>
<li>Processing done after getting back data from network or IO call.</li>
</ol>


<p>Execution flow for each of above steps is seperated and such that each of them can be executed from the event loop.</p>

<p>Notice that request and response objects are not passed to sub-functions. The sub-functions get access request and response since sub-functions are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures">javascript closures</a>. In fact if we move the sub-functions out-side getUserEvents method, it would not work. Which lead to chooice of keeping <i>givenUserFindAndReturnEvents</i> and <i>returnEvents</i> as sub-functions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">Curring</a> can be used to fix this problem, more on that in another blog.</p>

<p>Each of the sub-functions (<i>findUserAndReturnEvents</i>, <i>givenUserFindAndReturnEvents</i>, <i>returnEvents</i>) are executed asynchronously. functions <i>givenUserFindAndReturnEvents</i> and <i>returnEvents</i> are called call-back functions since they are triggered after getting back user object and event objects respectively from datastore.</p>

<p>The sub-functions could have been left as in-line or nested lamda functions. Nesting several such functions is another issue with call-backs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Key Points

<ul>
<li>Code is separated based on pre-network call and post network call.</li>
<li>The caller of the sub-function has to pass a callback function to execute after finishing sub-function task.</li>
<li>Sequential logic is expressed asynchronously.</li>
<li>Asynchronous code above is more scalable but may not be more performant (response time).</li>
<li>Call-back causes readability issues &ndash; callback hell.</li>
<li>Following execution flow is difficult, so called spaghetti-code.</li>
<li>Non-Blocking API&rsquo;s impose major constrain on how you structure your code.</li>
<li>Functions are hierarchy, i.e. calling function is responsible for functionality it provides as-well as the sub-function it calls. For example:&ndash; givenUserFindAndReturnEvents includes functionality of finding and returning Events to http response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Promise based solution</i></b></p>

<p>To solve Call-back issues like spaghetti-code, we could use code structuring library like <a href="http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/">q promise</a>. Promise library provides some code style standards and structuring, making it more readable compared to call-back based code shown above.</p>

<p>Notice how code is split into smaller independent functions and how they are chained together using <i>.then</i> and <i>.fail</i> functions. Another important feature of promise library is how exception flow is handled. Compare promise based code with the call back based one above. Observe that errors are handled in each of the call back functions and when using promise, errors are isolated and handle seperately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Key Points

<ul>
<li>Functions are flat, i.e. calling function is responsible for only its own functionality and can be used independently. For example :&ndash; findUser can be used independent of loadEventsForUser.</li>
<li>Spliting sequential code into indenpendent functions which are reusable in multiple scenarios is not always easy. Many times functions are created just to work around Non-blocking reactive pattern.</li>
<li>Functions can be used in other flows and could form reusable components.</li>
<li>Better readability compared to call back option but not as simpile as sequential option</li>
<li>Better exception handling compared to call back option but not as simple as sequential option.</li>
<li>When libraries don&rsquo;t support promises, we end up writing boiler plat code to create promise and to handle async flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Conclusion</i></b></p>

<p>Async or Non-blocking IO introduces new challenges on how applications should to be structured and how async call backs can be abstracted away using promises like library. We need Non-blocking IO application since, sequencial blocking IO applications are not scalable. So Non-Blocking IO or Asynchronous code is not a desired feature but a nessesary evil to achive scalability.</p>

<p>Finally, assumption that Non-blocking IO and Asynchronous code are clubed together and one comes with other. Is it possible to get the best of both the worlds, i.e. Sequential code and Non-Blocking IO scalability. In fact, I think there is an option based on Fibers which can provide best of both the worlds. I will cover Fibers and how they achive both Non-Blocking IO and Sequential codebase in the next blog.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Zen-Of-Software-Design-Part-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I call it Zen of Software Design.. instead of <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a> since it applies to all of software design and not only to python. The poem itself is presented at the bottom of this blog for reference and below is my interpretations and thoughts on it.</p>

<p>Lines 1 to 9 of <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a> is covered in this blog, Lines 10 to 19 will be covered in Part 2.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Interpretation</i></b></p>

<p>The way to read &ldquo;better than&rdquo; statements in above poem, is to understand that one does not always win over other and both have their place under sun. But the poem advocates one over another when all things are equal and there is a choice to be made. i.e. leaning or favoring one over another.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Beautiful is better than ugly</i></b></p>

<p>While it is easy to understand that beautiful is better than ugly, it is very subjective to know beautiful from ugly. If you look at source code as an art, like a painting, bad code/design will stink (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code-smell</a>) and make you  uncomfortable instinctively. I don&rsquo;t think there are standard rules by which you can differentiate beautiful from ugly design similar to paintings. I guess it comes from looking at different codebase and experience.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Explicit is better than implicit.</i></b></p>

<p>It should be obvious to figure-out what&rsquo;s happening in code, for someone not familiar with the codebase. Usually implicit design makes it look like bloack magic without any clue how it is working or where to look for related code. There are two kind of implicits we face in day-to-day work.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Well known implicits :&ndash; Things which are well documented and have become standard way of doing things. These implicits usually go across project team boundaries. Example : SpringMVC annotations, Rails conventions</p></li>
<li><p>Project implicits :&ndash; Things which project teams builds within the project which is not something a new developer would be acquainted with in other projects.</p></li>
</ul>


<br>


<p>I have seen developers going overboard with Annotations or conventions in projects, where it is difficult to figure-out how things work. A rule of thumb I use to figure out if we have gone overboard is by asking myself the question &ldquo;Can I explain, to a new developer joining team, all the implicit things happening in the project within 1 hour session?&rdquo;.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Simple is better than complex.</i></b></p>

<p>Again this seems very obvious but still elusive. No one wants to create a complex system but creating simple design/software is a complex job.</p>

<p>Few questions which help me be on track of simplicity</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How many execution flows/paths exists?</p>

<p>if there are few execution paths than its easy to keep them in mind and figure out a specific scenario falls in which one of the paths.</p></li>
<li><p>How easy is it to figure-out a given scenario falls under which execution path?</p>

<p>It should be easy to figure that out, if the application is well designed and simple to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>How many exceptions flows exist as against conventional flows?</p>

<p>In every application there are few exceptional scenarios which don&rsquo;t fall under normal execution paths and need exceptional flows for them. These should be minimal and explicitly identified.</p></li>
<li><p>How easy it is to explain high level design to a new developer?</p>

<p>I found this rule of thumb to be very helpful. It becomes obvious when you explain (or imagining to explain) how application works to a new developer. If you can explain it without flinching several times when the developer says &ldquo;ah in scenario x app will do this&rdquo; and you go hmmm its mostly correct but there are some other issues etc.</p></li>
</ul>


<br/>


<p><b><i>Complex is better than complicated.</i></b></p>

<p>Design can be complex because domain is complex but sometime domain is simple but software is designed or implemented in complicated way. Design should be as-complex or as-simple as the requirement needs, not more and not less.</p>

<p>The questions I ask to figure out if design is complicated is</p>

<ul>
<li>What part of requirement is causing the design to be complex?</li>
<li>Is the technology choice introducing additional complexity?</li>
<li>Is there any negotiable requirement which can be removed to make it more simpler?</li>
<li>Are we designing the system for future proofing which might not be required?</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<p><b><i>Flat is better than nested.</i></b></p>

<p>When we look at code there are few obvious cases where this is true. For example it is better to have several flat functions than having one long nested function. For example :&ndash; Using Strategy Design Pattern or Command Design pattern to separate code into independent units. Where it is not very obvious and still useful to think is</p>

<p><b><i>Sparse is better than dense.</i></b>
<b><i>Readability counts.</i></b></p>

<p>Few times I have questioned myself if single responsibility principle, unit testing, dependency injection and design patterns are good. The reason for this doubt is that after following single responsibility principle, unit testing with dependency injection and following design pattern, a small codebase grows to considerable code size.  I call this new increased codebase sparse compared with earlier code which was dense.</p>

<p>The advantages of sparse code base compared to dense code is</p>

<ul>
<li>It is easier to understand and modify.</li>
<li>It is easier to extend to add more scenarios.</li>
<li>It is easier to isolate an issue and fix it.</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<p><b><i>Special cases aren&rsquo;t special enough to break the rules.</i></b>
<b><i>Although practicality beats purity.</i></b></p>

<p>Good software Architecture/Design usually settle with a set of rules like</p>

<ul>
<li>Execution flows/paths</li>
<li>Logical Architecture Layers and how each layer communicated with another layer.</li>
<li>Inter-process communication protocols</li>
</ul>


<p>Every now-and-then a new requirement which breaks design rules under which application has operating comes in. Usual tendency is to treat this as special case which works differently to existing architecture.</p>

<p>While it might be the right approach in few cases, we should</p>

<ul>
<li>strive to see if this special case can be modelled as one of the existing flows</li>
<li>check if existing rules can be extended to incorporate the new requirement as first class design decision instead of treating it as special case which breaks the rules.</li>
<li>check if we have been adding a lot of special cases and do a course correction if required.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the other hand if they truly are special cases and trying to extend or modeling it has one of the existing flows make design complicated, we should not hesitate to incorporate the new requirement as special case as a pragmatic/practical architect or developer should do.</p>

    <id>http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Reactor-Pattern-Part-2-Non-blocking-I-O</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Reactor-Pattern-Part-1-Non-blocking-I-O/">Reactor Pattern Part 1 : Applications with Blocking I/O</a>, I went through issues faced by a single threaded application to scale to handle more requests pre box.</p>

<p>In this blog, we will look at an alternative solution to maximise CPU usage.</p>

<p>The diagram below from the part 1 blog we can notice that applications require CPU in busts and they have wait periods between the processing busts.</p>

<p><img class="article-img" border="0" height="325" width="480" src="http://venkateshcm.github.io/img/blog/ThreeThreads.png" class="" style="display: inline-block;"></p>

<p>If we treat processing busts as events and queue events to be executed on a single thread, we can make sure the thread (CPU) is always occupied and thus giving us maximising CPU usage and avoiding unnecessary context switching.</p>

<p>Consider processing blocks as events without any I/O calls within them which can be executed non-sequentially/asynchronously. The code should be split into execution blocks (events) which can be executed separately with other requests events executed between them.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Event Loop</i></b></p>

<p>An event loop is a program loop where a thread waits for events and executes events that occur in a program. For more info on checkout Event Loop</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Unix File Descriptors</i></b></p>

<p>Following Unix principle of everything is a file, file descriptor is used to detect events when reading/writing to file, network communication, device communication and inter-process communication. System calls &ldquo;epoll&rdquo; and &ldquo;pselect&rdquo; are used to detect file descriptor state change without blocking application.</p>

<p>The below diagram shows a simplified event loop which goes through four stages in each loop.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check if a new event is created (i.e. a web request has come in or a call back event has occurred) and add new event is added to the queue.</li>
<li>Pick an event from the queue</li>
<li>Execute event</li>
<li>Create a call-back event (i.e. database query or network access call-back when the response has arrived. Call-back events are handled by epoll or pselect.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="article-img" border="0" height="325" width="480" src="http://venkateshcm.github.io/img/blog/EventLoop.png" class="" style="display: inline-block;"></p>

<p>The solution described above is a simplified version of Reactor Pattern.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Advantages of Reactor Pattern</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Optimal usage of CPU.</li>
<li>Can handle more requests with same hardware.</li>
<li>Can scale above C10K limit</li>
</ul>


<br/>


<p><b><i>C10K Problem</i></b></p>

<p>Historically, Reactor Pattern came into prominence after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">C10K problem</a> and <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">Solution to C10K problem</a> using Non-Blocking I/O succeeded.</p>

<br/>


<p><b><i>Disadvantages of Reactor Pattern</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Asynchronous event based code base makes it difficult to understand and structure code. Promise library can help.</li>
<li>Debugging code will be more difficult since stack trace begins from the call-back instead of start of request.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of the disadvantages can be mitigated by using fiber (ruby fibers, node fibers), will cover Fibers in another blog.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<br/>


<p><b><i>Applications with Blocking I/O</i></b></p>

<p>I am assuming a simple scenario of single threaded application like Ruby on Rails Application running on a computer with single CPU. In real world, OS splits CPU time to multiple applications and does a regular context switching.</p>

<p>In a single threaded application like Ruby on Rails Applications, requests are processed by a single thread. When the thread makes a I/O bound call like database query or network call, application/thread is blocked even though it could be used to work on other requests.</p>

<p><img class="article-img" border="0" height="325" width="480" src="http://venkateshcm.github.io/img/blog/SingleThread.png" class="" style="display: inline-block;"></p>

<p>A solution to get around the above problem is to have multiple applications running on the same box. So when one application&rsquo;s thread is blocked another application&rsquo;s thread can proceed with another request processing. In below diagram there are two applications competing for CPU time and second application consumes CPU between a2 and a1 time. But we still see that CPU is idle between a1 and t1 and between t2 and a2.</p>

<p><img class="article-img" border="0" height="325" width="480" src="http://venkateshcm.github.io/img/blog/TwoThreads.png" class="" style="display: inline-block;"></p>

<p>To avoid any idle time on CPU we can add more applications, but this will lead to unnecessary context switch which will degrade performance further. For example in the diagram below, third application is switched with second application while third application is still processing a request and needs CPU time.</p>

<p><img class="article-img" border="0" height="325" width="480" src="http://venkateshcm.github.io/img/blog/ThreeThreads.png" class="" style="display: inline-block;"></p>

<p>As shown in the above diagram, we can notice two issues</p>

<ul>
<li>OS switches CPU from an application which needs CPU for processing.</li>
<li>OS switches CPU to an application which is still waiting for IO.</li>
</ul>


<p>These two issues are due to pre-emptive thread switching. To achieve optimal CPU allocation, application should be able to request for CPU time or give-up CPU time in a cooperative manner instead of pre-emptive switching.</p>

<p><b><i>C10K Problem</i></b></p>

<p>Early in 2000, a single server could not handle more than 10000 connections at a time. It was a limitation under which applications worked and developers were not able to exceed 10000 connections limit on a single box. The solution that was found is to use nonblocking I/O on each thread i.e. Non-blocking IO stared as a scalability soultion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">C10K Problem</a>.</p>

<p>Reactor Pattern provides an work around for the above problem using epoll.</p>

    <id>http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/silver-bullet-solution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While working on a solution for a problem, we try to find a solution which works in all conditions or situations. There are egos built-up on which solution is better or solves all the problems.
But rarely have I seen a solution which fixes the problem completely with-out any side effects.</p>

<p>What usually happens is we</p>

<ul>
<li><p>move the problem (or issue) from one area to other area.</p>

<p>Example :&ndash; In database normalisation we improve performance of add/update by normalising but causing read performance issues.</p></li>
<li><p>solve one problem at the cost of introducing another problem.</p>

<p>Example :&ndash; We introduce redundancy to gain retrieval performance at the cost of multiple updates (due to redundancy).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This shows that problems are not really solved but just moved around or converted to a different problem.</p>

<p>But we still find and use solutions you might say. Yes, we do and we do it by trading off one type of problem to another type of problem.</p>

<p>So the Art of finding a solution to a problem is identifying problems you are willing to live-with and problems you can not compromise on.</p>

<p>In fact, I have found different solutions by just compromising on a dimension of existing solution and to find a new solution.</p>

    <id>http://venkateshcm.github.io/2014/04/Restful-Web-Services</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><p><b><i>Guidelines to get Restful Web Services right</i></b><p></p>

<p><b><i>Uniform Resource handling</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Allow discoverability of new resources. Similar to adding new link to existing page (resource) to allow access to new page (new resource).</li>
<li>Take advantage of intermediary components between client and server. ( Caches, Proxies, Firewalls etc)</li>
<li>Follow consistent approach to view/modify/create operations on any resource.</li>
<li>Make conscious trade-offs between cache-ability, discoverability, performance and convenience</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Safe Methods</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Client requests are readonly.</li>
<li>Client can make duplicate requests without causing unintended side-effects. Similar to loading the page again in browser.</li>
<li>Does not mean server will respond with same response to the new requests. Similar to reloading(F5) a page in browser may get different/modified response (new data) on dynamic web page.</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Idempotent Methods</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Client can replay the request if client is not certain server has processed the request due network failure or other errors.</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Follow HTTP standards</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use Request Methods as defined by HTTP</p>

<ul>
<li>Get, Head, Options methods

<ul>
<li>should be safe (readonly) i.e. should not cause side effects on resource representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get, Head, Options, Put, Delete

<ul>
<li>should be idempotent i.e. replay of request (due to network failure or uncertainty) should not cause issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post

<ul>
<li>Can cause side-effects and does not guarantee safety or idempotent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use Request MIME Types to encode representation</li>
<li>Use HTTP status code for responses status</li>
<li>Keep Restful Services Stateless &mdash; maintain state in client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>URL of the resource</p>

<ul>
<li>Url of the resource represents the hierarchy.</li>
<li>For example : www.school.com/class/<1>/subject/<english>/

<ul>
<li>In the above example school has classes</li>
<li>classes has subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Frequently Asked Questions :</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is PUT Request for Creation and POST for updating ?</p>

<ul>
<li>Both PUT and POST can be used for Creating new resource or Updating an existing resource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deference between PUT and POST ?</p>

<ul>
<li>PUT is idempotent and client can be replay the request if network failure or system error without causing issues on server. Use PUT to completely replace existing resource representation or create new resource representation.</li>
<li>POST is not idempotent and general purpose method without restrictions and corresponding benefits. Use POST when other verbs don&rsquo;t fit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When to use POST ?</p>

<ul>
<li>POST is general purpose method which can be used when other HTTP verbs don&rsquo;t fit well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><br/></p>

<pre><code>[Using] POST only becomes an issue when it is used in a situation for which some other method is ideally suited:
e.g., retrieval of information that should be a representation of some resource (GET), complete replacement of 
a representation (PUT), or any of the other standardized methods that tell intermediaries something more valuable
than “this may change something.” The other methods are more valuable to intermediaries because they say something
about how failures can be automatically handled and how intermediate caches can optimize their behavior. POST does
not have those characteristics, but that doesn’t mean we can live without it. POST serves many useful purposes in
HTTP, including the general purpose of “this action isn’t worth standardizing.”
                    --- Roy T. Fielding (http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>How does HTTP Safety and Idempotent work during concurrent requests?</p>

<ul>
<li>Safety and Idempotent are defined in non concurrent condition.

<ul>
<li>Good analogy to understand is load a web page in browser and on reloading the page browser can get new version of the page. Server could also deny GET request if agreed number of requests has been reached. User should not worry about making duplicate requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example,

<ul>
<li>A replay GET request can return new representation if resource is modified by another request.</li>
<li>A replay GET request can return modified representation like updated hit/access count.</li>
<li>A failed GET request after allotted number of calls are made to a given resource, does not violate Safety rule.</li>
<li>Get request with authentication token can fail on second request. Safety does not grantee same response every time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Can a single GET request return two or more different resources? Can a resource contain other resources?</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, they can but it comes at the cost of cache-ability.</li>
<li>For example:&ndash;</li>
</ul>


<p><b><i>Car Resource</i></b></p>

<p>GET /car/:licenceNumber</p>

<pre><code>{
    make : 'Toyota',
    model : 'Rav4',
    color : 'Red',                              
    owner : {
                link : '/car/:licenceNumber/owner',
                firstName : 'John',
                lastName : 'Smith',
                address : {
                                streetName : '300 Boylston Ave E'
                                city : 'SEATTLE',
                                state : 'WA',
                                zipcode : '98102'
                                country : 'USA'
                        }
            }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>The above GET request for resource Car given a license number will return information on car, owner and owner address. Server might expose owner and owner address as resources as-well. As shown below.</p>

<p><b><i>Car Owner Resource</i></b></p>

<p>GET /car/:licenceNumber/owner</p>

<pre><code>{
    firstName : 'John',
    lastName : 'Smith',
    address : {
                link : '/car/:licenceNumber/owner/address',
                streetName : '300 Boylston Ave E'
                city : 'SEATTLE',
                state : 'WA',
                zipcode : '98102'
                country : 'USA'
             }
}
</code></pre>

<p><b><i>Car Owner Address Resource</i></b></p>

<p>GET /car/:licenceNumber/owner/address</p>

<pre><code>{
    streetName : '300 Boylston Ave E'
    city : 'SEATTLE',
    state : 'WA',
    zipcode : '98102'
    country : 'USA'
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, Car Resource contains Owner resource which in turn contains owner address resource. But Server exposes two other end point for owner and owner resource.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are three levels at which a developer can operate during software development.</p>

<p><b><i>How</i></b></p>

<p>First Level or basic level is when someone is told what needs to be done. He/She does what is told. At this level the design is handed over to you and you are just implementing someone else&rsquo;s design without fully understanding implications of design.</p>

<p>Change Area :&ndash; Implementation. Software Design is fixed but implementation is altered by team.</p>

<p>Example :&ndash; Software company is provided with design documents with object class specifications and asked to implement the software.</p>

<p><b><i>What</i></b></p>

<p>Second Level or intermediate level is when someone is given a requirement and allowed to design and implement the software without major restrictions on how the requirement is designed or implemented. At this level developer is given freedom to choose different implementation options which achieve the desired requirement.</p>

<p>Change Area :&ndash; Software Design and Implementation. Requirements is not allowed to change by team.</p>

<p>Example :&ndash; Software company is provided with use case documents or requirement documents and asked to implement the software according to specifications given in requirement documents.</p>

<p><b><i>Why</i></b></p>

<p>Advanced Level is when someone understands the business goals of the application and is allowed to choose requirements, design and implementation to active the business goal. As Project Managers, Product Owners, Analysts and Developers start working on designing/implementing features and requirements, they understand the business goals and why something is being build.</p>

<p>Change Area :&ndash; Software Requirements, Design and Implementation. Business goal can not be changed by team.</p>

<p>Example :&ndash; Project team is formed with co-sourced members of business and software company and Teams goes through Inception process. During Inception process, the team gains first hand understanding of business goals and how they relate to features/requirements.</p>
